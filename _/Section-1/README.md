# Section 1: Microservices with Java EE 8

This first section lays the foundation for building microservices with Java EE 8. All the upcoming sections will build upon the basics presented here. You will learn about the challenges of cloud native application development and how the Java EE 8 APIs address these. You will build your first microservice using a modern cloud-ready app server runtime, containerize and compose the service, and finally deploy and run your service on Kubernetes.
