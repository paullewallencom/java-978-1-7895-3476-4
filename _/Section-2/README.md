# Section 2: Service Exposition via REST APIs and Messaging

Communication and service exposition is at the heart of every microservice architecture.
In this section we will have a look at synchronous and asynchronous communication
between microservices. You will learn how to build loosely coupled interfaces and
service clients, how to document you REST endpoints with Open API, and how to build
message-driven microservices with Java EE.
